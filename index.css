                            The CSS file
                            
  *** end ascii art ***
  
  A lot of people get into months long javascript framework
  boondoggles for reasons they could have solved in 5 minutes 
  fiddling with the humble CSS file.
  
  The penultimate best CSS framework is the one where every design 
  meeting you, the HTML/CSS Engineer (paid more than any of the 
  Javascript Jocks) are rolling your eyes at the cravat wearing 
  designer and sarcastically holding up a sticky note that says: 
  "What about the standards, bro?"
  
  But the absolute best HTML/CSS Framework is the one where the
  designers are writing the CSS and HTML. Drop photoshop, drop 
  whatever flavor of the week closed-source Mac only garbage you've 
  been sending me that is just bad SVG and write some HTML and CSS. 
  
  Design is about application of material facts (and yes, 
  HTML/CSS is a material fact on screen in browser), so start 
  applying the materials.
  
  A lot of people think CSS folk aren't Engineers, or that 
  Designers can't become good engineers, but I know better. A lot 
  of you designers and CSS pushers are already better engineers 
  than the Javascript Jocks around you.
  
  I know. I see you. Here's where you wow them.
